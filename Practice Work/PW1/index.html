                        <p>Bootstrap, originally named <b>Twitter Blueprint</b>, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company."
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter's development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011. It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as well as a large community of contributors.

                    <p>Bootstrap is compatible with the latest versions of the Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera and Safari browsers, although some of these browsers are not supported on all platforms.</p>
                    <p>Since version 2.0 it also supports responsive web design. This means the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically, taking into account the characteristics of the device used (desktop, tablet, mobile phone).</p>
                    <p>Starting with version 3.0, Bootstrap adopted a mobile first design philosophy, emphasizing responsive design by default.</p>
                    <p>The version 4.0 alpha release added Sass and Flexbox support.</p>
                    <p>Bootstrap is open source and available on GitHub.Developers are encouraged to participate in the project and make their own contributions to the platform.</p>
